    Donald Trump hits out at "corruption, scandal, and failure" after being charged with plotting to overturn the 2020
    election result
    "I have never had so much support on anything before," he claims after Tuesday's indictment
    The charges follow an inquiry into the attack on the US Capitol in Washington DC on 6 January 2021
    Trump is accused of "spreading lies" about election fraud for more than two months
    In total, Trump has now been charged in three criminal cases - but experts say the latest could be the most serious
    The other cases relate to secret documents, and payments to Stormy Daniels, a former porn star
    Despite the criminal cases, Trump is the favourite to be the Republican candidate in the 2024 election

    Japan and the US set to strike a deal to develop an interceptor missile to counter hypersonic warheads made by
    China, Russia and North Korea

    Japan and the US will this week agree to develop an interceptor missile to counter hypersonic warheads made by
    China, Russia and North Korea, it was claimed yesterday.

    The agreement to target weapons designed to evade ballistic missile defences is expected when President Joe Biden
    meets Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida in the US on Friday.

    The report, published in Japan’s Yomiuri newspaper, gave no source for the information, and officials at Japan’s
    Ministry of Foreign Affairs could not be reached for comment last night.

    Unlike typical ballistic warheads which fly on predictable trajectories, hypersonic projectiles can change course –
    making them more difficult to target.

    Mr Biden and Mr Kishida are due to meet during a trilateral summit with South Korea’s president Yoon Suk Yeol at
    Camp David, Maryland, the report said.

    The US and Japan agreed in January to consider developing the interceptor at a meeting between Secretary of State
    Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin with their Japanese counterparts.

    A deal would be the second such collaboration in missile defence technology after Washington and Tokyo developed a
    longer-range missile designed to hit warheads in space.

    Japan is deploying the missile on warships in the sea between it and the Korean peninsula to defend against any
    North Korean strikes.
