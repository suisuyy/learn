    Donald Trump hits out at "corruption, scandal, and failure" after being charged with plotting to overturn the 2020 election result
"I have never had so much support on anything before," he claims after Tuesday's indictment
The charges follow an inquiry into the attack on the US Capitol in Washington DC on 6 January 2021
Trump is accused of "spreading lies" about election fraud for more than two months
In total, Trump has now been charged in three criminal cases - but experts say the latest could be the most serious
The other cases relate to secret documents, and payments to Stormy Daniels, a former porn star
Despite the criminal cases, Trump is the favourite to be the Republican candidate in the 2024 election
